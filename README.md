# IMDB-Movies-Analysis
This is an IMDB movies analysis to find the top rated movies, the impact of movie release month on revenue and more.

# Introduction
Isn't it frustrating, that you have just had a long day and want to detox with a movie? You get home, wear your comfy pants, take a blanket, pick up the remote, open Netflix, Prime, or whatever, find a movie, and only realize 30 minutes into the movie that the movie is not that good. Now you gotta find another movie or consider a more low-key activity like reading a book, listening to a podcast, or worse just leave it and go to sleep. Well, I have been there, not once but almost every time I want to watch a movie. 

So here is an IMDB movie analysis, that can help you to never go through that ever again. The dataset I used is the TMDb (The Movie Database) which is a comprehensive movie database that provides information about movies, including details like titles, ratings, release dates, revenue, genres, and much more. This dataset contains a collection of over 1,000,000 movies from the TMDB database.

# Background
Special thanks to [Chanin Nantasenamat](https://data-professor.medium.com/) the Data Proffessor for sharing his work on Machinine Learning ([How to build your ML model](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-machine-learning-model-439ab8fb3fb1)) which helped me build a Movie Revenue Prediction model basing on budget, language, genre,release month and runtime.

### The questions answered in the Analysis
1.	Top-rated movies and low-rated movies (using rating and vote count)
2.	High-budget movies
3.	High-profit movies
4.	Correlation between budget and rating
5.	Correlation between budget and profit
6.	Identify trends in movie release dates and analyze their impact on revenue.
7.	Create a revenue prediction model using features such as budget, language, genre,release month and runtime.

# Tools I Used
These are the tools that i used for my Analysis:
- **Python:** The backbone of the analysis, allowing me to sift through the large datasets and help discover critical insights.

- **Excel:** I used Excel for further cleaning and filtering.

- **Algorithms Used:** Random Forest and Linear regression

  # KEY TAKEAWAY
  I NEED TO IMPROVE MY MODEL BUILDING SKILLS FOR BETTER ACCURACY
